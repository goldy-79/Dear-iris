<h1 class="line">Hello xyyy, sai, Kiarre Sia, Rin Yvesia, Iris, and Xyrene!!</h1>

<p class="line">This is my first letter and also a reply to yours that I’ve written or coded in a long time.</p>

<p class="line">So please don’t mind any grammatical errors I’m gonna make.</p>

<p class="line">Anyway first and foremost thank you.</p>

<p class="line">I’ve probably already told you this so many times but I really can’t help it.</p>

<p class="line">I’m thankful for you for entering my life.</p>

<p class="line">And for God for creating someone as amazing beautiful and talented as you.</p>

<p class="line">Yes you. I'm pointing at you.</p>

<p class="line">At this moment of my life, you've become someone thats VERY very important to me na, someone who I'm afraid to lose.</p>

<p class="line"> I quite literally have LOTS and LOTS to say to you so let's go down the memory lane shall we?</p>

<p class="line">I remember it was July 29, 2024.</p>

<p class="line">The first time I've met you.</p>

<p class="line">To be honest I didn't expected you to be someone who I will be so attached to.</p>

<p claas="line">I thought that the relationship between us will only be same to my relationship to those of our fellow classmates.</p>

<p class="line">Looking back then, the reasons for our first interaction was actually due to rafael's racist humor,</p>

<p class="line">and of course due to my talkative nature, I decided that it was a good idea to talk with you guys and try to be friends with the three of you (You, Dinara, Ramiel)</p>

<p class="line">and boy was definitely one of the best decisions I've done and will do on Earth.</p>

<p class="line">Because that was the start of our conversations, that was when we started talking,</p>

<p class="line">and most importantly, that was how I started knowing you.</p>

<p class="line">And as I grew closer and closer to you everytime we talked, that was when I realized...</p>

<p class="line">"oh no... I'm in love."</p>

<p class="line">Which was something I didn't really expect to say, especially during that time when I was pretty much hating on the thought of 'love'.</p>

<p class="line">anyways it took me a few days to muster up my courage to confess to you.</p>

<p class="line">And at exactly September 14, 2024 at 8:08:33pm...</p>

<p class="line">i sent you my confession message,</p>

<p class="line">only to be shocked in the next 20 mins to know that you've felt the same for me HAHAHA.</p>

<p class="line">That day has become so memorable to me that it became a password to not only 1 or 2 or 3 but ALL of my accounts in the games that I've played.</p>

<p class="line">As for why i did that?</p>

<p class="line">Well my memory isn't really that sharp, but I do remember my passwords pretty well so it's my way of keeping it in my memory</p>

<p class="line">And as I'm writing this letter, its been exactly 462 days, 5 hours, 35 minutes and 28 seconds ever since that moment...</p>

<p class="line">Okay that's enough flashback XD.</p>

<p class="line">To tell you the truth, I wasn't really looking for someone during that time.</p>

<p class="line">In fact, I was doing the opposite; I was trying to run away from it since it was actually just a few months after I got my heart broken.</p>

<p class="line">But you...</p>

<p class="line">yes you.</p>

<p class="line">was so special that I was willing to love once again even if it meant bleeding my own hands trying to keep my heart together just so that I was able to love you wholly.</p>

<p class="line">And as of this moment, there has not been a single day where i have regretted it.</p>

<p class="line">Although yes we did have times when we had confusions and misunderstandings, we were able to address it and fix it. </p>

<p class="line">I'm very very proud of what you've done up to this moment.</p>

<p class="line">Athough you might think differently and say something along the lines of "but i could've done better" Or "my grade 9 self would be dissatisfied with the current me. "</p>

<p class="line">Well I believe that your grade 9 self would've been proud for you for not giving up </p>

<p class="line">even though the amount of responsibilities you've had and the stress you're currently handling has increased exponentially.</p>

<p class="line">Instead of criticizing you,</p>

<p class="line">I'm sure that your past self would give you a VERY tight and VERY warm hug.</p>

<p class="line">And para sa akin, you should give yourself those things too;</p>

<p class="line">not just the hugs, but also the acknowledgement.</p>

<p class="line">Acknowledgment that you are enough, and what you've done was enough.</p>

<p class="line">I hope that you'll take even more care of your body, </p>

<p class="line">don't abuse it too much by pulling up all nighters for like 7 days a week.</p>

<p class="line">Always take care of yoursel.</p>
